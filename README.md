# DHT22WeatherStation
Temperature-and-Humidity Weather Underground station based on DHT22 (RHT03) and ESP8166 Thing Dev board

The state of the project: The circuit and Arduino Sketch seem to be working. Next Step: design a 3D printable enclosure. See Diary.odt for details.

The Arduino Sketch requires a Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing Dev board, a DHT22 (RHT03) temperature sensor, a level shifter, and a few wires. Details are in BillOfMaterials.ods.
